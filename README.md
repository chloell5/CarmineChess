## Play Chess with Ruby!

This is a little side project I created in order to practice Ruby fundamentals while studying at Turing. Initial goal is going to be a simple ASCII board meant to be played with two human players. When basic functionality is complete, I will work to make a more complex and pretty board, and potentially incorporate a GUI. Long term goals are a potentially dangerous computer opponent.
